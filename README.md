CRYPTOCURRENCY LENDING USING NFT AS COLLATERAL

A novel approach to cryptocurrency lending by leveraging non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) as collateral on the Ethereum blockchain. The rise of cryptocurrencies and the emergence
of NFTs have introduced groundbreaking innovations in the financial landscape. NFTs, unique digital
assets representing a wide range of items, have gained significant attention and value in recent years, as
they are a way of storing assets in the digital world.
Among other usages of the technology, the ones in de-fi (decentralized finances) are some of the
most exciting and have real-world usages if implemented in coordination with the capabilities of the
blockchain.
Traditional cryptocurrency lending relies primarily on collateral in the form of other
cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, limiting access to loans for individuals without such assets. The
motivation behind this research project is to explore the feasibility of utilizing NFTs as collateral within a
cryptocurrency lending protocol, aiming to enhance accessibility and liquidity in the lending market. This
innovative approach allows individuals to secure loans by leveraging their non-fungible digital assets in a
secure and transparent manner. Some of the limitations that separate this system from also being
implemented in the world of real, physical assets is the fact that there is still no way of correlating real
world ownership with the digital one.
